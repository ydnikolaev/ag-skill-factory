Browser Subagent
When the agent wants to interact with the browser, it invokes a browser subagent to handle the task at hand. The browser subagent runs a model specialized to operate on the pages that are open within the Antigravity-managed browser, which is different from the model you selected for the main agent.
This subagent has access to a variety of tools that are necessary to control your browser, including clicking, scrolling, typing, reading console logs, and more. It can also read your open pages through DOM capture, screenshots, or markdown parsing, as well as taking videos.
While the agent is controlling a page, it will show an overlay on the page with a blue border and a small panel with short descriptions of the actions being taken. When this is shown, you will not be allowed to interact with the page to ensure it doesn’t get confused by your actions.
The browser subagent can act on tabs that are not focused, so you are free to open other tabs and use them uninterrupted as it works.
