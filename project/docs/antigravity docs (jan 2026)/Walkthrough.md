Walkthrough
Agent creates walkthrough artifacts when it has completed task implementation; this type of artifact includes a concise summary of the changes that have been made to remind the user of what has happened in the active conversation. This is a great way to get up to speed with the state of your codebase after Agent has made its changes in case you were not strictly following it the whole time.
