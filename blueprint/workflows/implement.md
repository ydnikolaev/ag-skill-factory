# Implement Workflow

Execute implementation after tech-spec is approved.

## Steps

1. Read approved tech-spec from `active/specs/`
2. Activate `@backend-go-expert` for backend work
3. Activate `@frontend-nuxt` for frontend work (parallel if possible)
4. Follow TDD Protocol (Red → Green → Refactor)
5. Create implementation docs in `active/backend/` and `active/frontend/`
6. On completion → delegate to `@qa-lead`

## TDD Enforcement

> [!CAUTION]
> See `../standards/TDD_PROTOCOL.md` — test-first is mandatory.

## Trigger

- Tech-spec approved
- "Start implementing feature X"
