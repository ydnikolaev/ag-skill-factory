# AGENTS.md - AI Agent Context

> This file provides context for AI agents working on this project.
> Read this first before making any changes.

## Project Overview

**ag-skill-factory** is a skill management system for Antigravity AI agents.

### What it does:
1. **Defines skills** - Markdown-based agent skill definitions in `squads/`
2. **Validates skills** - Python validator ensures skills meet standards
3. **Installs skills** - Go CLI (`skills`) deploys to workspaces
4. **Syncs skills** - Bidirectional sync between factory and projects

## Key Commands

### Makefile (in this repo)
```bash
make install        # Validate all + install skills + build CLI
make validate-all   # Validate all skill definitions
make test           # Run all Go tests
make build-skills   # Build the skills CLI binary
```

### Skills CLI (in any workspace)
```bash
skills install      # Install all skills to .agent/skills/
skills update       # Update from factory (shows diff)
skills backport X   # Push local changes back to factory
skills list         # Show installed vs available skills
```

## Development Rules

### TDD Protocol
> [!CAUTION]
> **No code without failing test.**
> - Write test first
> - See it fail
> - Write implementation
> - See it pass

### Git Protocol
> [!CAUTION]
> **Use feature branches and Conventional Commits.**
> - `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `chore/...`
> - `feat(cli): add backport command`
> - Never push directly to main

### Test Coverage
The test `internal/coverage/coverage_test.go` will **FAIL** if:
- Installer package coverage drops below **95%**
- A Go package has no `_test.go` files
- Expected test files are missing

> [!TIP]
> **Afero Integration**: The `internal/installer/` package uses `spf13/afero` for testable file I/O.
> Tests use `afero.MemMapFs` (in-memory) and `afero.ReadOnlyFs` (error injection).

## Skill Format

Skills are defined in `squads/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: What the skill does
---

# Skill Name

## When to Activate
- Trigger conditions

## Workflow
1. Step 1
2. Step 2

## Team Collaboration
- `@other-skill` - How to collaborate

## Handoff Protocol
...
```

---

## Config

The CLI reads from `~/.config/ag-skills/config.yaml`:

```yaml
source: /path/to/ag-skill-factory/squads
global_path: ~/.gemini/antigravity/global_skills
```

---

## Important Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `squads/TEAM.md` | Auto-generated skill roster |
| `squads/PIPELINE.md` | Visual workflow diagram |
| `squads/_standards/` | Shared protocols (TDD, Git) |
| `go.mod` | Go module definition |
| `Makefile` | Build/test/install automation |

## When Working on This Project

1. **Adding a new skill**: Use `python3 .agent/skills/skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py <name>`
2. **Adding a new CLI command**: Create `cmd/skills/<name>.go` + add tests
3. **Modifying installer**: Edit `internal/installer/installer.go` + update tests
4. **Checking coverage**: Run `make test` - will fail if tests missing

---

## Dependencies

- Go 1.23+
- Python 3.x (for skill validator)
- Cobra (CLI framework)
- Viper (config management)
- Afero (filesystem abstraction for testing)
