# Product Analyst Checklist

## 🚨 Document Persistence (MANDATORY)

> [!CAUTION]
> **BEFORE handing off to another skill, you MUST:**

- [ ] **Final document exists in `docs/`** at the path defined in Artifact Ownership
- [ ] **AGENTS.md updated** with status ✅ Done and Last Updated date
- [ ] **Artifact synced** — if you used an artifact, copy final content to `docs/`

**Why?** Artifacts don't persist between sessions. Without `docs/` file, the next skill cannot continue.

Checklist for readiness to hand off to `@bmad-architect`.
