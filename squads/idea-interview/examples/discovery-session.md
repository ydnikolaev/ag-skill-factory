# Example: Discovery Session

Example of a typical interview session.

## User Request
> "I want to build a habit tracking app"

## Agent Response (Block 1: Business Context)

Hey! Let's figure out your idea. Starting with business context:

1. **What problem are we solving?** People forget about habits, don't see progress?
2. **Any competitors?** Habitica, Streaks, Loop — how will yours be better?
3. **Monetization model?** Freemium, subscription, one-time purchase?

## User Response
> "Yeah, I want a simple tracker without gamification, just statistics. Competitors are too complex. Planning freemium — basic habits free, analytics for subscription."

## Agent Response (Block 2: Target Users)

Got it, minimalism + deep analytics as premium. Now about users:

1. **Who's the typical user?** Age, usage context?
2. **Main scenario?** Mark habits in morning, check progress at night?
3. **Different roles needed?** Or just one user type?

## Output: Discovery Brief

After collecting all information, the agent creates `docs/discovery-brief.md` and requests confirmation via `notify_user`.
