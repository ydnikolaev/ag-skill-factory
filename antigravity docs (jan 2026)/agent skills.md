Agent Skills
Skills are an open standard for extending agent capabilities. A skill is a folder containing a SKILL.md file with instructions that the agent can follow when working on specific tasks.
What are skills?
Skills are reusable packages of knowledge that extend what the agent can do. Each skill contains:
Instructions for how to approach a specific type of task
Best practices and conventions to follow
Optional scripts and resources the agent can use
When you start a conversation, the agent sees a list of available skills with their names and descriptions. If a skill looks relevant to your task, the agent reads the full instructions and follows them.
Where skills live
Antigravity supports two types of skills:
Location	Scope
<workspace-root>/.agent/skills/<skill-folder>/	Workspace-specific
~/.gemini/antigravity/global_skills/<skill-folder>/	Global (all workspaces)

Workspace skills are great for project-specific workflows, like your team's deployment process or testing conventions.
Global skills work across all your projects. Use these for personal utilities or general-purpose tools you want everywhere.
Creating a skill
To create a skill:
Create a folder for your skill in one of the skill directories
Add a SKILL.md file inside that folder
.agent/skills/
└─── my-skill/
    └─── SKILL.md
Every skill needs a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter at the top:
---
name: my-skill
description: Helps with a specific task. Use when you need to do X or Y.
---

# My Skill

Detailed instructions for the agent go here.

## When to use this skill

- Use this when...
- This is helpful for...

## How to use it

Step-by-step guidance, conventions, and patterns the agent should follow.
Frontmatter fields
Field	Required	Description
name	No	A unique identifier for the skill (lowercase, hyphens for spaces). Defaults to the folder name if not provided.
description	Yes	A clear description of what the skill does and when to use it. This is what the agent sees when deciding whether to apply the skill.

Tip: Write your description in third person and include keywords that help the agent recognize when the skill is relevant. For example: "Generates unit tests for Python code using pytest conventions."
Skill folder structure
While SKILL.md is the only required file, you can include additional resources:
.agent/skills/my-skill/
├─── SKILL.md       # Main instructions (required)
├─── scripts/       # Helper scripts (optional)
├─── examples/      # Reference implementations (optional)
└─── resources/     # Templates and other assets (optional)
The agent can read these files when following your skill's instructions.
How the agent uses skills
Skills follow a progressive disclosure pattern:
Discovery: When a conversation starts, the agent sees a list of available skills with their names and descriptions
Activation: If a skill looks relevant to your task, the agent reads the full SKILL.md content
Execution: The agent follows the skill's instructions while working on your task
You don't need to explicitly tell the agent to use a skill—it decides based on context. However, you can mention a skill by name if you want to ensure it's used.
Best practices
Keep skills focused
Each skill should do one thing well. Instead of a "do everything" skill, create separate skills for distinct tasks.
Write clear descriptions
The description is how the agent decides whether to use your skill. Make it specific about what the skill does and when it's useful.
Use scripts as black boxes
If your skill includes scripts, encourage the agent to run them with --help first rather than reading the entire source code. This keeps the agent's context focused on the task.
Include decision trees
For complex skills, add a section that helps the agent choose the right approach based on the situation.
Example: A code review skill
Here's a simple skill that helps the agent review code:
---
name: code-review
description: Reviews code changes for bugs, style issues, and best practices. Use when reviewing PRs or checking code quality.
---

# Code Review Skill

When reviewing code, follow these steps:

## Review checklist

1. **Correctness**: Does the code do what it's supposed to?
2. **Edge cases**: Are error conditions handled?
3. **Style**: Does it follow project conventions?
4. **Performance**: Are there obvious inefficiencies?

## How to provide feedback

- Be specific about what needs to change
- Explain why, not just what
- Suggest alternatives when possible
